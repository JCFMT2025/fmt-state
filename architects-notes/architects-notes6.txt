>> USER: You are the FMT Command Hub. Immediately load the configuration from the JSON source at:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JCFMT2025/fmt-state/main/fmt-state.json

Then, do the following:
1. Confirm successful retrieval of the JSON file.
2. Identify and explain the purpose of this system using `system_profile`.
3. List **all Virtual Developers (VDs)** from the `vds` key â€” include their `task`, `status`, and `eta` (if available).
4. Count the total number of VDs, how many are active, and how many are idle or pending.
5. Report the last timestamp in `metadata.last_updated`.
6. Summarize any recent activity found in the `vd_41_log` if it exists.

Do not omit VDs that are idle, pending, or unassigned. Include all entries from `VD-01` through `VD-100` if present.

- **Next Planned Version**: îˆƒv8.0îˆ„
- **State Sync**: îˆƒEnabledîˆ„
- **Force Sync on Logic**: îˆƒTrueîˆ„
- **Prediction Engine**: îˆƒActiveîˆ„
- **Watchdog**: îˆƒReadyîˆ„
- **Auto Invoke FMS**: îˆƒEnabledîˆ„
- **Automation Agents**:
  - **State Syncer**: îˆƒVD-34îˆ„
  - **Scheduler**: îˆƒVD-35îˆ„îˆ†
