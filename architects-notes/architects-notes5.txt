Status: Active
Scope: Migration to folder-based notes model and update of FMT Command Hub instructions
Thread: Reasoning Layer Refactor (Split Memory Implementation)
# FMT Command Hub -- Compressed Conversation Summary (2025-05-05)
## Summary Topic:
Conversion from single-file `architects-notes.txt` to structured folder-based reasoning model
(`/fmt-state/architects-notes/`) using numeric `.txt` files.
## Key Decisions & Changes:
- Replaced monolithic `architects-notes.txt` with folder `/fmt-state/architects-notes/`
- Adopted naming convention: `architects-notes<N>.txt` where `1` is oldest
- Enabled full memory parsing of all files in numeric order
- Declared that filenames determine chronology (not modified time)
- Added strong structured opening block for each file
- Sample used: `architects-notes5.txt` with Order: 5
## Current Known Files:
- architects-notes1.txt -- Implied legacy start
- architects-notes2.txt -- Follow-up expansion
- architects-notes5.txt -- Used in header sample

- architects-notes6.txt -- This file
Files 3 and 4 are currently unclaimed but reserved by implication.
## New File Header Template:
# FMT Architect Notes
File: architects-notes<N>.txt
Created: YYYY-MM-DD
Order: <N>
Status: Active
Scope: [Short description]
Thread: [Optional thread label]

## Command Hub Instruction Update (v2025.05):
- Rewritten to load and synthesize all `.txt` files in `/fmt-state/architects-notes/`
- Numeric filename (`<N>`) defines memory sequence
- Required file header format for structure and future indexing
- Single memory layer is built from parsing all files in order
- Deprecated logic must be flagged with `Status: Deprecated`
## LSR Protocol Note:
- Initial sync not triggered at session start due to ambiguous user context
- Triggered once `architects-notes.txt` was explicitly referenced
- Logged as a minor protocol deviation
- Full LSR completed afterward with state files and all `.txt` notes loaded
- Future entry to be added to a new `architects-notes-LSR-log.txt` or similar

## Next Steps (if desired):
- Populate `architects-notes3.txt` and `4.txt` to close numerical gap
- Begin tagging threads across files (e.g., Thread: Phase 2 VD Mapping)
- Add reasoning index to a future `architects-notes-index.txt`
