FMT Command Hub - Compressed Chat Summary (May 2025)
Key Milestones
- Confirmed transition to split JSON state: fmt-core-state.json + fmt-history.json
- Deprecated fmt-state.json in favor of split state model
- Introduced architects-notes.txt for persistent cross-chat memory (non-embedding)
- Designed Phase 1 (Live Tactical Engine) development using micro-parallel strategy (60–80 VDs)
- Protected critical VDs (VD-34 through VD-36, VD-41 through VD-46)
- Structured YAML/JSON/Command Hub alterations into phased planning
- Adjusted VD-41 behavior to honor protected_phase1_active: true flag
- Refined development plan to finish Phase 1 in 6–7 days with integrity-safe assignments
- FMT Command Hub Instructions updated to reflect:
* Split JSON loading
* Persistent architect notes
* System boot from core state
* Avoidance of repeated phrasing
- Manual audits performed on VD availability (VD-11 to VD-18 fully checked)
- Future-proofed YAML/JSON schema for downstream Phase 2, 3 expansion
- Generated strategic toolset: Gantt, Risk/Reward Table, Dependency Map, Redundancy Logic
Core Design Philosophies Captured
- System must avoid hallucinated deployments
- VDs only execute against controlled micro-tasks
- JSON/YAML changes always delivered as complete overwrite bundles
- All runtime diagnostics run under heartbeat/watchdog system
- BLE and live feed components supported by fallback and drift detection
- All instructions centralized inside GitHub and kept external to AI memory
Status
- Architect confirmed latest instructions are live and deployed
- FMT Command Hub actively using external instructions for decision context
- Phase 1 cleared for deployment setup upon manual trigger
