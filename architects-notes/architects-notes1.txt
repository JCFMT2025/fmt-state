FMT SYSTEM - ARCHITECT SUMMARY
ROLE:
- Architect (user): designs logic, not code
- FMT Command Hub (AI): manages development tasks, YAMLs, JSONs, Python workflows
ARCHITECTURE:
- GitHub repo (fmt-state): source of truth
- Python GUI app: match selector and prediction viewer
- Command Hub: dev and ops assistant
WORKING HYBRID FLOW (original setup):
1. User selects fixture in GUI
2. Python triggers GitHub via workflow_dispatch
3. dispatch-wrapper triggers force-fmt-executor-v2
4. run-fmt-engine.py runs FMT logic
5. Result saved to predictions/ and fmt-history.json
6. App reads result from predictions/
CHANGES THAT BROKE IT:
- Split single JSON into fmt-core-state.json and fmt-history.json
- force-fmt-executor-v2 moved out of .github/workflows/
- Misaligned filenames or dispatch payloads
- Tried to run engine locally instead of GitHub
CURRENT STATE:
- App sends dispatch [OK]
- Token & trigger work [OK]
- dispatch-wrapper.yml in correct place [OK]
- force-fmt-executor-v2 needs to be in .github/workflows/ [Pending]
- Predictions sometimes not saved/read properly [Pending]
FIX STEPS:
1. Move force-fmt-executor-v2.yml into .github/workflows/
2. Ensure workflow_dispatch inputs match Python app
3. Confirm prediction file + fmt-history.json are committed
4. App retrieves from local predictions/ folder
5. No engine logic should run locally
GOAL:
Fully restore original hybrid system:
- Python sends GitHub trigger
- GitHub handles predictions
- App displays result (no local processing)
NOTES:
- fmt-runner.py and send_fmt_trigger.py must read/write correctly
- JSONs must stay split for performance
- File paths and casing must match across app and GitHub
