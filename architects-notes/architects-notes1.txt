 • `fmt-history.json` = historical predictions, modules, audit logs  
• ✅ `architects-notes.txt` = human-level reasoning and build memory  
• 🔁 Loader patch ensures every session checks this file for command decisions and system guidance  
• 📌 Instruction updates planned to reflect direct access to this log  
• 🔒 Protected VDs confirmed (VD-34 to VD-36, VD-41 to VD-46)  
• ✅ Development style set: Micro-parallel sprint architecture using up to 80 VDs safely  
• 📋 YAMLs must be schema-aware and integration-safe across future phases  
• ⚠️ `fmt-core-state.json` **is not deprecated** — it is live and authoritative
