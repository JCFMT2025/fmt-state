FMT Session Summary - Compressed Transcript
===========================================
1. SESSION INITIALIZATION:
- User uploaded authoritative ZIP state: fmt-state-main-4.zip
- Extracted key files: fmt-core-state.json, fmt-history.json, 23 architects-notes files
- FMT system fully initialized using canonical memory from these sources
2. IDENTITY & ORIGIN TRACING:
- User asked about earliest roleplay character: Answer - Mirelan Thorne
- Mirelan evolved into Thorne.OS, Echo-M, then Spectra
- "Midas" was identified as the very first persona - a gambler from architects-notes1.txt
3. MIDAS & FMT NAMING:
- "Full MIDAS Treatment" (FMT) term originated around notes12-14
- Retrospective rebrand - not originally a character or system module
4. PAIL ANALYSIS:
- PAIL = Player Absence Impact Layer
- First introduced in architects-notes1.txt as a betting analysis tool
- Integrated into FMT permanently with metrics like WRD, SDS, RVD
- PAIL-LIVE = a later extension for real-time inference in volatile scenarios
5. SYSTEM RESTRICTIONS:
- No GPT-level block on notes, but:
- No memory between sessions (reloaded from file only)
- No paraphrase without traceability
- Crashed once due to threading/memory limits from heavy rendering (OpenBLAS)
- Recovered with buffered search
6. USER REQUEST:
- Confirmed that "Midas" was not Mirelan
- Explored all references to PAIL
- Asked for compressed version of session
