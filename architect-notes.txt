â€¢ System split confirmed: fmt-state.json for logic, fmt-history.json for prediction logs  
â€¢ Deprecated: fmt-core-state.json â€” replaced by proper split pattern  
â€¢ Architect confirms all new chats should reference this file for reasoning continuity  
â€¢ Loader override patch now working: correctly loads from remote core state
